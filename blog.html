		  	I am reading about Sontag again. It has an effect on me, it makes me hungry, eager to write and occupy my day in thousands of projects. 
			Sontag wanted to eat the world, to understand it all. 
			She reminds me I too long for an intellectual life.

			Today while reading her biography by Benjamin Moser, I remembered that time in Groningen when I was added to the <i>''Groningen Intellectual Powerhouses''</i> WhatsApp group. 
			It happened one evening after a book presentation from the Faculty of Philosophy at the Academy Building, a building I loved and I rarely went to — we natural scientists were placed outside the city. 
			The book was a popular account of <i>“philosophy of the world”</i> in 250 pages. Naturally, simplified to the point of caricature. I was outside, in the stairs, ready to depart and try to forget about the things I heard that session, when I guy approached me asking my thoughts on the presentation. 
			I seem to have succeeded forgetting all of the presentation, I remember nothing of what I told him other than my feelings: that the book sounded terrible. Whatever I said, it was enough to make an impression, and he invited me to a party with other philosophy students and offered me to add me to the WhatsApp group. 
			I declined his invitation, but gave him my number. I was added, yet I never joint them in any meetings not engaged on their conversations. In all honestly, I thought of it as ridiculous. <i>Who calls themselves 'intellectual powerhouses'?</i> I would tell my friends, laughing. Now I regret it, while likely a group of self-importance graduate students, they were interested in the same things I was interested in: intellectual discovery and discussions —and wasn't I positioning myself above them by laughing and refusing to take them seriously? What a pretentious hypocrite! How I miss now to discuss books with random people on stairs!

			Anyway, time to get back to Sontag. Perhaps eventually I will also dare to write about her. Or maybe I will create the <i>“Lausanne Intellectual Powerhouses”</i> WhatsApp group.

				As I write these words the idea of writing a blog starts materializing, always with the disclaimer ‘might delete later’. This time Ellen and Ben convinced me to do it. Well, Ellen doesn't know that she did, but I have been largely inspired by <a href="https://philosomama.blogspot.com">her blog</a></li>. 
				Probably my writings won't be like Ellen's. Ellen writings are so natural and personal; I can only hope to have a sense of her warm and honesty.

					Here I want to write about science, departing from the rigid and often uninteresting ways of academic writing. 
					That on itself is a difficult task. 
					I've learned English mainly from academic texts and my style reflects that fact. I write <i>myriad</i>, <i>utilise</i>, <i>elucidate</i>, and many other words that might infuriate more than one native English speaker. 
					Hopefully someday I will find a voice that is less artificial, less boring, and simpler. 
					Over the past year I've become a more proficient academic reader: I read, I think, I often re-read and sometimes I write small notes. 
					Overall my hands do the easiest job and most of the time they rest. 
					I had enough of that. 
					I want to write about my ideas, my questions, and the articles I find interesting, not because I have many ideas or because the ones I have make any sense (most of them surely don't), but it seems like an useful way of keeping track and giving me the time to develop them more deeply.
				</p>
				<p class="slab_paragraph">  	
					Inevitably, I'll write about film too. Those who know me are aware I'm always watching films and often talking about them. Films have always been an important part of my life and nowadays I have immersed myself on them with certain seriousness. 
					There's a type of beauty in films which I cannot find elsewhere, and I want to understand where my feelings come from. 
					In Alice in the Cities, Rüdiger Vogler character notes  <i> “Talking to yourself, that's actually more like listening than speaking” </i> — I guess that's the whole point of this something like a blog.
