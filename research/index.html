			All living forms are organized in a nested hierarchy. Genes and other replicating nucleic acids formed genomes; 
			Eukaryotic cells were formed by the union of free-living eubac- teria and proto-eukaryotes. 
			In all cases, previously autonomous entities came together to form new wholes higher in the biological ladder. 
			This dynamic process is a transition in individuality. 
			The objective of this report is to assess the evolutionary individuality of bacterial plasmids, autonomous replicating DNA entities enclosed within bacterial cells.
