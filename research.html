            Currently, there's a strong interest in microbiology to improve community functions via directed evolution. However, selection methods for improved community function have shown limited success. 
            Together with <a href="https://wp.unil.ch/mitrilab/" target="_blank">Sara Mitri</a>, we suggest that this result could be a consequence of competition among species members within communities: if competition within communities is strong, selection at the member species can override selection at higher levels. For my project, I am focusing on designing an artificial selection method to transition bacterial communities into evolutionary individuals â€” that is, into units of selection. To this aim, I'm simulating a selection method driving the transition in individuality by decreasing competition within communities and increasing competition between them.

            Evolutionary individuality is a type of biological individuality that understands biological individuals on the basis of natural selection.  
            For my project, I assessed the evolutionary individuality of bacterial plasmids, autonomous replicating DNA entities enclosed within bacterial cells. 
            Although plasmids are commonly understood as parts of the bacterial genome, there's a growing body of ready research that considers plasmids are biological individuals in their own right. 
            I analysed and evaluated the distinct views on plasmid individuality and concluded that, rather than being antagonistic, they are complementary.
